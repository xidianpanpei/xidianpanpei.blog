"Rebaaaaaaaase.":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTK0kFXJjd0 I'm always looking for great projects to feature, so don't hesitate to "let me know":http://rebase.github.com/howto.html about yours!

h3. Featured Project

*"redis":http://github.com/antirez/redis/tree/master* is a key-value store that just hit 1.0.0. "So what?":http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/FAQ Well, it's "ridiculously fast":http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/Benchmarks, can handle sets and lists along with strings as values, it can asynchronously dump its data, supports sharding on the client side, and plenty more that wouldn't fit here. It's easier to think of it as a data structures server instead, or as an aptly named 'REmote DIctionary Server'. The code is all here on GitHub if you're a C hacker, and its API is well documented. Bindings are already available in "Ruby":http://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb/tree/master, "Python":http://code.google.com/p/redis/source/browse/#svn/trunk/client-libraries/python, "PHP":http://code.google.com/p/redis/source/browse/#svn/trunk/client-libraries/php, and more so you can play around with it today.

h3. Notably New Projects

*"clevercss":http://github.com/Poromenos/clevercss/tree/master* is a much less verbose version of CSS that's Python backed. This means, of course, it obeys the normal Python indentation rules, which ends up being a good thing. Unlike "HAML":http://github.com/nex3/haml/tree/master, it tries hard to still look like normal CSS, but it does allow some magic like pseudo-class shortcuts, grouping shortcuts, constants, and even some basic <code>Color</code> and <code>String</code> methods if you're feeling daring. If you're a Pythonista and want write CSS easier, definitely give this a look.

*"TeXorator":http://github.com/ianh/TeXorator/tree/master* is a "LaTeX":http://www.latex-project.org/ viewer that auto-refreshes the document it's looking at when changes are made. All you need is OSX and LaTeX installed, and you should be set. It also shows errors that may occur during the document's generation. This definitely seems like a fun and useful project to hack on, and seeing the idea ported to other operating systems would be neat as well.

*"spde-examples":http://github.com/n8han/spde-examples* combines two fantastic projects of the Java world: "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/ and "Processing":http://processing.org. Well technically, "Spde":http://technically.us/spde/About does the hard stuff, but this repo contains some seriously cool examples of how it can look. You could check out an example applet "here":http://technically.us/spde/Fold, but you'll be better served by cloning and running it yourself.

*"philip-rss":http://github.com/philipn/philip-rss/tree/master* is the first RSS reader that I can personally stand to use, mostly because it's integrated deeply into Firefox. The workflow is simple: click Firefox's built in RSS reader button to subscribe, and then a new RSS icon button in your lower right hand corner gives you a nifty view of your feeds. The UI is minimalist in a good way: it's simple and doesn't get in your way. Check out a more visual tutorial and how to install it "here":http://mathburritos.org/code/philip-rss/.
