h3. Notable Projects

* "acts_like_git":http://github.com/courtenay/acts_like_git/tree/master: Crappy name, but this Rails plugin really does some neat stuff. It allows you to essentially wrap a model around a git repository. This plugin has been in the works for a while, but "court3nay":http://www.github.com/court3nay "announced that it's ready":http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2008/11/15/new-plugin-acts_as_git for the world this week. This is definitely an awesome example of collaboration and cooperation on GitHub!
* "activeritalin":http://github.com/lukegalea/activeritalin/tree/master: I just had to check out this project. This disables @find_by_sql@ to prevent ugly hacks and shortcuts from cropping up in your app. What's better is that it adds a new method, @find_by_sql_with_excuse@ to really ensure that you have to think twice about it. Who needs coding standards when you can just have a plugin enforce it? 
* "roxy":http://github.com/yfactorial/roxy/commits/master: This is a fantastically easy way to make your Ruby code extendable and easier to use. In a manner similar to association extensions and named scopes in Rails, Roxy allows you do define proxy methods on the fly. Check out "rwdaigle's":http://github.com/rwdaigle "blog post for some more examples":http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/11/10/implement-ruby-proxy-objects-with-roxy.

Next week I'm going to start a "Hardcore Forkers" section that will feature users who have been active on the site. Let me know if you have any other ideas for the column.
